 * An API for manipulating general-purpose I/O pins.
 */

/*
 *
 * The GPIO shim allows access to the processor's general purpose I/O pins.
 * These pins are normally used for low-speed devices like switches and
 * indicators, or to perform board functions such as device reset or
 * interrupt notification.  GPIO pins can also be used for moderate-speed
 * data transfer, emulating a low-speed communications bus via software
 * control.
 *
 * The gxio_gpio API, declared in <gxio/gpio.h>, allows applications to
 * allocate particular GPIO pins, then assert, deassert, or sense the state
 * of those pins.  The API is designed to be a minimal wrapper around the
 * GPIO hardware, making system calls only for configuration purposes.
 *
 * We strongly recommend reading the GPIO section of the IO Device Guide
 * (UG404) before working with this API.  Most functions in the gxio_gpio
 * API are directly analogous to hardware interfaces, and the documentation
 * assumes that the reader understands those hardware interfaces.  Proper
 * configuration and use of GPIO pins generally requires knowledge of
 * specific details of the system design, such as might be found in the
 * hardware reference manual or board schematics.  Note that in many
 * systems, a subset of the available pins are used for board control
 * purposes and are not available via the gxio_gpio API.
